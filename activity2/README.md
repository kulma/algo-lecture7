# Activities

## Task 1

- Refer to the following link. Discuss the characteristics of Greedy approach:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-approach-vs-dynamic-programming/

  > Greedy approach tries to find a local solution to the first subproblem and goes on to the next one. Then it adds the solutions as the answer. It doesn't return to the previous subproblems even if new information becomes available so it doesn't always find the best/optimized answer for the whole problem. 

## Task 2

- Explain how the code in `./src/fkp.cp`p works. Refer to the following link:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fractional-knapsack-problem/

## Task 3

- Explain how the code in `./src/asp.cpp` works. Refer to the following link:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/activity-selection-problem-greedy-algo-1/

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- Refer to te following link. Explain the differences between Greedy Algorithm and Dynamic Programming
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-approach-vs-dynamic-programming/

> Both of them are used to solve optimization problems. Greedy algorithm makes decisions based on the information available at the time of decision where as Dynamic Programming breaks the problem into subproblems and uses recursion to solve them. Dynamic Programming produces the optimal solution but can be slower than using the Greedy algorithm method.
