# Activities
## Task 1

- Refer to te following link. Explain the Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.
  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction/

> Dijkstra's algorithm uses the Greedy method to try to find the shortest path from the source vertex to all the other vertices of the graph. The distance of the source vertex is marked as 0 and all the others as infinity. It starts with the nearest vertex and continues to it's neighbours. Dijkstra's algorithm uses weight of the edge and the distance to calculate shortest path. The algorithm terminates when it has visited all of the vertices or finds the destination vertex.

## Task 2

- Explain how the code in `./src/dspa.cpp` works. Refer to the following link:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/

## Task 3

- Explain how the code in `./src/mspt.cpp` works. Refer to the following link:
  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kruskal-s-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm-greedy-algorithm-in-cplusplus#

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- Refer to te following link. Explain when to use the greedy methods and when to avoid them.
  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/when-to-use-greedy-algorithms/

>The Greedy method provides the best available option. So it works well when any solution is better than no solution at all. It doesn't work with graphs that have negative edges and it doesn't work well with the traditional 0-1 knapsack problem.
